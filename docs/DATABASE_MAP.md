### Polymorphic Relationships

| Child | Parents | Implementation | Description |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Grade | Homework OR Exam | `homework_id` XOR `exam_id` | Grade belongs to either homework or exam |

### Many-to-Many Implementation Details

#### Student-Course Enrollment
- **Implementation**: Array field `students` in Course collection
- **Access Pattern**: `Course.students` contains array of User ObjectIds
- **Query Example**: `Course.find({ students: studentId })`

#### Student-Homework Grades  
- **Implementation**: Grade collection as junction table
- **Key Fields**: `student_id`, `homework_id`, `homework_type`
- **Access Pattern**: Each student gets one Grade entry per homework
- **Query Example**: `Grade.find({ student_id: studentId, homework_type: 'traditional' })`

#### Student Partnerships
- **Implementation**: Partner collection as junction table  
- **Key Fields**: `student1_id`, `student2_id`, `homework_id`, `homework_type`
- **Access Pattern**: Each partnership creates one Partner entry
- **Query Example**: `Partner.find({ $or: [{ student1_id: studentId }, { student2_id: studentId }] })`

## Data Integrity Rules

### Unique Constraints
1. **User**: `auth0_id`, `email`, `username` (when present)
2. **StudyProgress**: `(student_id, date)` - one record per student per day
3. **Partner**: `(homework_id, student1_id, student2_id)` - unique partnerships

### Validation Rules
1. **Grade**: Must have either `homework_id` OR `exam_id`, not both
2. **Partner**: `student1_id` must differ from `student2_id`
3. **StudyProgress**: `hours_studied` must be between 0-24

### Cascading Behaviors
- **Soft Deletes**: Most collections use `is_active` flag instead of hard deletes
- **References**: No automatic cascading - application handles related record updates

---

## Database Statistics

| Collection | Estimated Avg Size | Growth Pattern |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| User | 1 KB per doc | Linear with users |
| Course | 2 KB per doc | Linear with courses |
| Class | 1 KB per doc | High volume (multiple per course) |
| Homework | 2 KB per doc | Medium volume |
| StudentHomework | 3 KB per doc | High volume |
| Grade | 1 KB per doc | Very high volume |
| Exam | 2 KB per doc | Low-medium volume |
| StudyProgress | 2 KB per doc | Very high volume (daily per student) |
| Partner | 0.5 KB per doc | Low-medium volume |
| RoleRequest | 0.5 KB per doc | Low volume |

---

## Notes

1. **Timestamps**: All collections use Mongoose `timestamps: true` for automatic `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields
2. **Virtual Fields**: Many collections define virtual fields for relationships (populated on demand)
3. **Soft Deletes**: Most collections use `is_active` boolean flag instead of hard deletion
4. **Auth0 Integration**: User collection syncs with Auth0 via `auth0_id` and `lastSynced` fields
5. **Grade Submission**: Students self-report grades (lecturers only verify deadlines, not grades)
6. **Partner Limitations**: Maximum 1 partner per student (pairs only)

## Removed Fields (For Database Cleanup)

The following fields have been removed from the schema models and should be deleted from the actual MongoDB database:

### Course Collection (`courses`)
- ‚ùå `partner_settings.enabled`
- ‚ùå `partner_settings.max_partners_per_student`

**Reason:** Partner settings are now controlled at the homework level, not course level.

---

### Class Collection (`classes`)
- ‚ùå `max_capacity`

**Reason:** Class capacity tracking was not being utilized.

---

### Homework Collection (`homeworks`)
- ‚ùå `points_possible`
- ‚ùå `instructions`
- ‚ùå `submission_type`

**Reason:** These fields were defined but not actively used in the application.

**Note:** `max_partners` field was updated from range (1-5) to fixed value (1).

---

### StudentHomework Collection (`studenthomeworks`)
- ‚ùå `verified_grade`
- ‚ùå `grade_verification_status`
- ‚ùå `grade_verified_by`
- ‚ùå `grade_verified_at`
- ‚ùå `grade_screenshot_path`
- ‚ùå `extracted_grade_data` (object with: extracted_grade, extracted_total, confidence, raw_text)
- ‚ùå `tags` (array)
- ‚ùå `moodle_assignment_id`
- ‚ùå `moodle_url`
- ‚ùå `priority`
- ‚ùå `points_possible`
- ‚ùå `claimed_grade`
- ‚ùå `completion_status`

**Reason:** 
- Grade verification removed (students self-report grades, lecturers only verify deadlines)
- OCR/screenshot functionality not implemented
- Moodle integration not functional
- Tags not used for filtering
- Priority field was used in code but never defined in schema
- **NEW:** `claimed_grade` and `completion_status` moved to Grade table for proper many-to-many relationship

**Updated Fields:**
- `deadline_verification_status` enum updated from `['unverified', 'verified', 'rejected', 'pending_review']` to `['unverified', 'verified', 'rejected']` (removed 'pending_review')
- `max_partners` updated from range (1-5) to fixed value (1)

**Index Removed:**
- ‚ùå Index on `grade_verification_status`

---

### Grade Collection (`grades`)
- ‚ùå `is_final`
- ‚ùå `points_possible`

**Reason:** These fields were not being used in the grading workflow.

---

### MongoDB Cleanup Commands

To remove these fields from the actual database, run the following commands in MongoDB:

```javascript
// Course collection
db.courses.updateMany({}, { $unset: { 
  "partner_settings": "",
}});

// Class collection
db.classes.updateMany({}, { $unset: { 
  "max_capacity": "",
}});

// Homework collection
db.homeworks.updateMany({}, { $unset: { 
  "points_possible": "",
  "instructions": "",
  "submission_type": "",
}});

// StudentHomework collection
db.studenthomeworks.updateMany({}, { $unset: { 
  "verified_grade": "",
  "grade_verification_status": "",
  "grade_verified_by": "",
  "grade_verified_at": "",
  "grade_screenshot_path": "",
  "extracted_grade_data": "",
  "tags": "",
  "moodle_assignment_id": "",
  "moodle_url": "",
  "priority": "",
  "points_possible": "",
  "claimed_grade": "",
  "completion_status": "",
}});

// Grade collection
db.grades.updateMany({}, { $unset: { 
  "is_final": "",
  "points_possible": "",
}});

// Drop removed indexes
db.studenthomeworks.dropIndex("grade_verification_status_1");
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Always backup your database before running cleanup commands!

## Recent Major Changes (December 2024)

### Grade Table Restructure
- **NEW APPROACH**: Grade table now stores individual student progress for ALL homework (both traditional and student-created)
- **Many-to-Many Relationship**: Each student gets a Grade entry for every homework they're enrolled in
- **Completion Status Tracking**: Individual student progress tracked in Grade table with `completion_status` field
- **Partnership Grading**: When one student grades themselves, their partner's Grade entry is automatically updated
- **Removed Fields**: `claimed_grade` and `completion_status` removed from StudentHomework table
- **Added Fields**: `homework_type`, `completion_status`, `completed_at` added to Grade table

### Benefits
- Proper many-to-many relationship between students and homework
- Individual student progress tracking
- Simplified partnership grading logic
- Consistent data structure for both traditional and student-created homework
